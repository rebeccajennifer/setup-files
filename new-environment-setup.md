This file includes steps for setting up my linux environment on a new machine. It's like my personal on-boarding guide.

# Windows

## Turn off alert sounds

Windows likes to make an alert sound every time tab complete doesn't work or other silly things. Turn it off in settings.

Go to Audio - change other sound settings
or

Sound -> sound control panel -> Sounds tab -> Sound Scheme dropdown -> No Sounds

In the window labeled `Sound` -> tab labeled `Sounds` select the menu option `No Sounds`
